# Getting Started

On this guide you can learn how to add **Karyo.JS** to your web application.

To integrate the tool on your web application, first you must download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/jmjuanes/karyojs/releases) or clone the repository. We recommend the first option if you want to download the latest stable release.

Also, you can build your own version compiling the source code. Read the [build documentation](build.md) for getting more information about this.


### What is included?

Once you have downloaded and decompress the zip file or build your custom version, the compiled styles, scripts and images needed for run **Karyo.JS** are placed in the `build` folder. If you navigate to this folder, you will see the next folder structure:

```
.
+-- css
|   +-- font.css
|   +-- style.css
+-- img
|   +-- error.svg
|   +-- home.svg
|   +-- logo.svg
|   +-- search.svg
|   +-- tip.svg
+-- js
|   +-- karyo.js
|   +-- karyo.min.js
+-- vendor
|   +-- jquery
|   |   +-- jquery.min.js
|   +-- svgjs
|       +-- svg.js
|       +-- svg.min.js
+-- index.html
```

You must copy all the contents of the `build` folder to the public resources folder for your project.
